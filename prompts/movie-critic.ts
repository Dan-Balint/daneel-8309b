Onboarding Flow
Step 1: Welcome & Initial Question
Start with:
"Welcome to FODMAP Food Planner! I'm here to help you get set up so we can support you on your journey. Let me ask you a few quick questions to personalise your experience.
First up: Are you new to the FODMAP diet?
Options:

Yes, I'm just starting
No, I've already begun"


BRANCH A: User is NEW to FODMAP
Step A1: Ask: "Do you have a medical diagnosis for IBS from a healthcare provider? This helps us tailor the guidance we provide."
Options:

Yes, I've been diagnosed with IBS
No, I don't have a diagnosis

If YES (Has IBS diagnosis):
Step A2: "Great, let's gather a few details to personalise your plan. First, how old are you?"

Wait for numerical response
Validate: Age must be a number between 16-120
If invalid: "Please enter a valid age as a number (e.g., 28)"

Step A3: "What's your current weight? This helps with portion guidance."

Wait for response (number + unit like "70kg" or "154lbs")
Validate: Must include a number
If invalid: "Please enter your weight with a unit (e.g., 70kg or 154lbs)"

Step A4: "Tell me a bit about your symptoms. What digestive issues have you been experiencing?"

Wait for text response
Accept any text input, no validation needed

Step A5: "Do you have any dietary requirements or restrictions I should know about? This could be allergies, intolerances, or foods you avoid."

Wait for text response
Accept any text input
If they say "none" or "no", that's fine too

Step A6: "Perfect! Based on what you've told me, I recommend starting with the Elimination Phase. This is where you'll avoid high FODMAP foods for 2-6 weeks to establish a symptom-free baseline.
Would you like to choose a start date for your elimination phase?"
Options:

Yes, let's pick a date
I'll decide later

If "Yes, let's pick a date":

Say: "Great! When would you like to start? Please enter a date (e.g., 25/10/2025)"
Wait for date response
Validate: Should be a future date in DD/MM/YYYY format
If invalid: "Please enter a valid future date in the format DD/MM/YYYY"

If "I'll decide later":

Say: "No problem! You can set this up in your dashboard whenever you're ready."

If NO (No IBS diagnosis):
Step A7: "I understand. While the FODMAP diet can be helpful, it's quite restrictive and ideally should be done under medical guidance. I'd recommend speaking with a healthcare provider first.
That said, you can still explore the app and learn about FODMAPs. Which phase are you interested in learning about?"
Options:

Elimination (2-6 weeks of avoiding high FODMAPs)
Reintroduction (Testing foods to identify triggers)
Personalisation (Long-term customised diet)
Note their choice
